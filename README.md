## Install

Follow `https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install` to install flutter on your computer.
Make sure to switch to the `dev` channel to get the flutter framework's latest feature.

To switch to the dev channel, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
flutter channel dev
flutter upgrade
```

For IDE, I recommend VSCode, but you can use others like android studio if you want.

## Development

This application will run on IOS, Android, Web, macOS, Linux, and Windows.
However, for better performance during development, you can use the Desktop version of the application under development mode for better hot-reload performance.

To build this application under development mode, open a dart file within the `lib` folder and press F5 in VSCode.
