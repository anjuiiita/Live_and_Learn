# Welcome to Live and Learn

LiveAndLearn (LAL) is an open platform for senior adults to learn how to use mobile applications. 
There are two parts of this platform:
1\. Mobile app 
2\. Web app

# Mobile app

LiveAndLearn mobile app provides voice-based tutorials for the most popular apps such as Gmail, Facebook, and WeChat. We want to introduce every useful function in those apps to the senior group. For some easy functions, we want to make sure the old could learn how to use them even without a look at the screen or press buttons. The targeting user group for the mobile app is all senior adults. The mobile app is built for both iOS and Android. Users can search tutorials with voice commands and all steps of each tutorial can be presented with voiceover functions. 

# Web app

LiveAndLearn web app provides a platform to create tutorials based on the template so that everyone can help the older groups learn new technology. The targeting user group for the web app is people with knowledge about how to use specific applications. We used nodeJS for the backend and express, bootstrap for the frontend. In this web application, users can create a tutorial for any application. He/She can also add multiple features for that tutorial. Each feature will have steps to learn about its functionality
